m4-on-markup
============

.Summary
There is still no consensus on the most flexible and most simple general
purpose markup.  Maybe this is not possible for applications as diverse
as web sites, program documentation, wikis and so on, but learning a
new tool after growing dissatisfied with the one currently used is a
desparate move for someone who just wants to add explanatory words
to his project. "m4-on-markup" is supposed to let people write their
document in a canonic form and try a tool from some selection to see
what it turns out.

The sources to my
http://spotteswoode.dnsalias.org:8080/website/[homepage] do not describe
this project well, but should serve as examples.
